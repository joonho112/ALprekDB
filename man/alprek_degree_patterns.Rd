\title{Load Degree Classification Patterns}
\usage{
alprek_degree_patterns()
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: \code{pattern_type}, \code{regex}, \code{result}, \code{priority},
\code{teacher_role}, \code{notes}.
}
\description{
Returns the regex-based classification patterns used to parse
free-text teacher degree/credential fields into standardized categories.
The codebook contains three pattern types:
\itemize{
\item \strong{degree_level}: Maps raw text to ordered education levels
(Waiver, Doctoral, Ed.S., Master's, Bachelor's, Associate, Coursework)
\item \strong{degree_area}: Maps raw text to subject area categories
(ECE, Elementary Education, Child Development, etc.)
\item \strong{degree_area_consolidation}: Reduces 9 area categories to 6
for cross-year comparability
}
}
\details{
Patterns are applied by priority (highest first). Waiver detection
(priority 100) overrides all other degree classifications. The \code{teacher_role}
column is currently \code{"all"} for all patterns but allows future role-specific
patterns.
}
\examples{
alprek_degree_patterns()

# View degree level patterns only
dp <- alprek_degree_patterns()
dp[dp$pattern_type == "degree_level", ]
