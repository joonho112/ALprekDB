\title{Generate Synthetic ALprekDB Data for Demonstrations}
\description{
These functions create realistic synthetic datasets that mirror
the structure and types of real ADECE Pre-K administrative data. They are
useful for demonstrations, vignettes, and testing without requiring access
to confidential data files.

All three generators share classroom codes when called with the same
\code{seed} and compatible \code{n_classrooms}, enabling cross-module linkage.
