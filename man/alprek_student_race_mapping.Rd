\usage{
alprek_student_race_mapping()
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: \code{raw_value}, \code{standardized}, \code{factor_order}.
}
\description{
Returns the mapping from raw race/ethnicity text values to
standardized categories for student data. Maps diverse raw entries across
all 4 years (e.g., "Black or African American" in 2021-22 vs
"Black/African American" in 2022-25) to a consistent set of 7 categories.
}
\details{
Standardized categories and their factor order:
\enumerate{
\item White
\item Black
\item Latino/Hispanic
\item Asian
\item Mixed
\item Other
\item Unknown
}
Note: Student race values differ from classroom teacher race values
(e.g., "Hispanic" appears in 2021-22 student data but not in classroom data).
